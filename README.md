# MicrobialBiodiversityTheory
Project repository for data and Python code associated with the following preprint:

Shoemaker WR, Locey KJ, Lennon JT. (2016) A unifying ecological theory of microbial biodiversity. PeerJ Preprints 4:e1450v3 https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1450v3

## Re-running the analyses and re-generating the figures

Files in the data folder ending with ".zip" will have to be unzipped before the code can be run.

To Figure2 and supplementary figures 1 and 2 you will need to request data, as the files are too large to store on GitHub. The data will need to be unzipped and in the main folder in a sub-folder named "data."

The code accepts the following arguments from the user.

**Flags**

**-a** or **--analysis:** Runs the analysis required for the figure.

**-f:**  The figure or table you want to generate. Indicate what figure/ table you want to generate after the flag using the table below.

| Argument |          Figure/ Table         |
|:--------:|:-----------------------:|
|     F1    |         Figure 1        |
|     F2    |         Figure 2        |
|    F3    |  Figure 3  |
|    F4    | Figure 4 |
|    FS1    |  Supplementary figure 1 |
|    FS2    |  Supplementary figure 2 |
|    FS3    |  Supplementary figure 3 |
|    FS4    |  Supplementary figure 4 |
|    FS5    |  Supplementary figure 5 |
|    FS6    |  Supplementary figure 6 |
|     T1    |         Table 1        |
|     T2    |         Table 2        |
|    TS1    |  Supplementary table 1 |
|    TS2    |  Supplementary table 2 |
|    TS3    |  Supplementary table 3 |
|    TS4    |  Supplementary table 4 |
|    TS5    |  Supplementary table 5 |
|    TS6    |  Supplementary table 6 |

### Order of operations

If you want to regenerate the data (warning, this is very computationally intensive and will take several days to complete) start with step 1, otherwise run step 2 for the figures.

1) Run the following command.

	python runAnalysis.py -a

2) Run this command

	python runAnalysis.py -f

  and indicate what figure  you want after "-f"
